### Institute of Data Science, National University of Singapore

I'm a third-year PhD student of National University of Singapore under the supervision of [Prof. Bryan Hooi](bhooi.github.io). My research interests include deep generative models, face recognition and visual object detection and tracking. Prior to this, I received my M.S. from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences where I was advised by Prof. Xilin Chen. I received my B.S. in computer science from Beijing Jiaotong University.


### News

September, 2021. I received [Google PhD fellowship 2021](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/?category=2021) on the machine learning track.

August, 2019. I will be joining IDS-NUS as a PhD student under the supervision of Dr. Bryan Hooi.

June, 2018. I received my M.S. from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

July, 2018. I received [IEEE ICME 2018 Platinum Best Paper Award](http://www.icme2018.org/conf_awards).
