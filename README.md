### Institute of Data Science, National University of Singapore

I'm a PhD graduate student from National University of Singapore under the supervision of [Prof. Bryan Hooi](bhooi.github.io). My research interests include deep generative models, face recognition and visual object detection and tracking. Prior to this, I received my M.S. from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences where I was advised by Prof. Xilin Chen. I received my B.S. in computer science from Beijing Jiaotong University.
